# Paper Figures Folder

This folder contains thumbnail figures for your publications.

## How to Add Paper Figures

1. **Name your files** using this pattern:
   - `paper1.png` - for your first publication
   - `paper2.png` - for your second publication
   - `paper3.png` - for your third publication
   - And so on...

2. **File format**: Use PNG or JPG format
   - Recommended size: 200-300px width
   - Keep file sizes reasonable (< 500KB)

3. **What to include in each figure**:
   - Architecture diagram
   - Key methodology visualization
   - Main result figure
   - Or any representative figure from your paper

## After Adding Figures

After you add your figures, update the HTML file (`index.html`) to point to the correct paths:
- Change `src="images/paper1.png"` to `src="images/papers/paper1.png"` (if you want to use this folder)
- Or keep them in the main `images/` folder if you prefer
